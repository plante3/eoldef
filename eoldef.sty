eoldef.tex, version 1.1

eoldef: define commands which absorb the whole source line as arguments.

Usage: \eoldef <control sequence> <parameter text> { <replacement text> }
defines a control sequence whose argument is delimited by the end of a
source code line.

For instance, `\eoldef\test#1:#2{}` and

    \test abc:def

will give `#1` = `abc`, `#2` = `def`.

`\eolgdef` is the `\global` variant to `\eoldef`.

Like `\verb|...|`, `\eoldef`'d commands may generally not be used as part of
another command's argument as it changes catcodes.
However, if you must use it in environments where catcodes are frozen, you
may follow the command with a braced argument, eg. `\test{#1:#2}` using the
previous example.

This package may be used in LaTeX by `\usepackage{eoldef}`, or in plain TeX
and other formats by `\input{eoldef}`.
